- Φάση Α
  - Rework config.properties to just have all of the addresses into one place, so that client can decided who is who.
  - Catch database connection error exception so that app just exits normally and doesn't crush - use the ERROR message type to notify reducer and client.
  - (Curiosity) Check what went wrong with the merge results algorithm in combiner (Mapper).
- Φάση Β
  - Make a plan about how many screens (Activity classes) will be needed.
